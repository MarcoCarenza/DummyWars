### DummyWars
*Game currently in Development*
 ## About
 DummyWars is the project I am currently working on. It is being developed in Unity.

 The plan for this game is for it to be a stragety shooter similar to games like XCOM.

 I plan on it being a simple game, with not too many complex design decisions. As I want to be able to gain the skills to add this kind of combat for a future game.

 The finished version of the game will be a polished game, with multiple levels, telling a simple story about the Dummy Wars.
 I plan on adding a speedrun mode as the final touch to the game.
